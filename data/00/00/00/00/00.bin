  |   A challenging action RPG with deep souls-like combat and rogue-like   |
  |   elements.                                                             |

  |   Explore a dreadful dungeon and fight smart enemies that will plan     |
  |   and collaborate between themselves to defeat you.                     |
  |                                                                         |
  |   COMPLETELY SKILL-BASED COMBAT: Each enemy has its own set of          |
  |   skills, behaviors and collaborations. Learn their patterns and        |
  |   discover their weakness before they lay their hands on you.           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   EXCITING PROGRESSION: Be responsible for rebuilding and maintaining   |
  |   your guild's village. Meet new characters, choose your traps, your    |
  |   weapons and keep track of your discoveries and unlocked content.      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   HANDCRAFTED & PROCEDURAL GENERATION: Designed to make each new run    |
  |   a completely new experience. Each room is handcrafted to get the      |
  |   most out of the combat, but you'll never explore the same dungeon     |
  |   twice.                                                                |
